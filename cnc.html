                   <h2> CNC </h2>
                    <p> CNC machining is the most widely used subtractive manufacturing technology.
                      In CNC, material is removed from a solid block using a variety of cutting tools to produce a part based on a CAD model.
                       Both metals and plastics can be machined with CNC. </p>
                    <p>There are two main types of CNC machining systems: milling and turning.</p>

                          <p> In CNC milling, the part is mounted onto the bed and material is removed using rotational cutting tools. </p>

                         <td> <h4>This is how a typical CNC turning machine would look like.</h4>
                           <p> In CNC turning, the part is mounted on a rotating chuck and material is removed using stationary cutting tools.
                             This way parts with symmetry along their center axis can be manufactured.
                              Turned parts are typically produced faster (and at a lower cost) than milled parts. </p>
